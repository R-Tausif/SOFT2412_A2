Cases to consider (remove this when finished):
- user can be anonymous or registered
- stored registered user and password
- password cannot be displayed and should be shown using *
- if the user exists, check if the password entered is correct
- transaction can be cancelled anytime
- check transaction for negative numbers + floating values (short, long), check for 0
- cancel the transaction if more that 2 mins timeout and return to the default list of products
- maintain a list for the user of the last 5 products/items bought ** check for anonymous users
- maintain the number of items - 7 at the start and 15 at max, so seller cannot sell more than 15 items from each category
